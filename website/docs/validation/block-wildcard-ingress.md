# Block Wildcard Ingress

## Description
Users should not be able to create Ingresses with a blank or wildcard (*) hostname since that would enable them to intercept traffic for other services in the cluster, even if they don't have access to those services.

## Template
```yaml
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: k8sblockwildcardingress
  annotations:
    metadata.gatekeeper.sh/title: "Block Wildcard Ingress"
    metadata.gatekeeper.sh/version: 1.0.1
    description: >-

          input.review.kind.kind == "Ingress"
          # object.get is required to detect omitted host fields
          hostname := object.get(input.review.object.spec.rules[_], "host", "")
