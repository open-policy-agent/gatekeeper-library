      Disallow the following scenarios when deploying PodDisruptionBudgets or resources that implement the replica subresource (e.g. Deployment, ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet):
      1. Deployment of PodDisruptionBudgets with .spec.maxUnavailable == 0
      2. Deployment of PodDisruptionBudgets with .spec.minAvailable == .spec.replicas of the resource with replica subresource
      This will prevent PodDisruptionBudgets from blocking voluntary disruptions such as node draining.
