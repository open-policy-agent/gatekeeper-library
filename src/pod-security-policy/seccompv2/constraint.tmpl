                Any container that uses an image that matches an entry in this list will be excluded
                from enforcement. Prefix-matching can be signified with `*`. For example: `my-image-*`.

                It is recommended that users use the fully-qualified Docker image name (e.g. start with a domain name)
                in order to avoid unexpectedly exempting images from an untrusted repository.

                An array of allowed profile values for seccomp on Pods/Containers.

                Can use the securityContext naming scheme: `RuntimeDefault`, `Unconfined`
                and/or `Localhost`. For securityContext `Localhost`, use the parameter `allowedLocalhostFiles`
                to list the allowed profile JSON files.

                The policy code will translate between the two schemes so it is not necessary to use both.

                Putting a `*` in this array allows all Profiles to be used.

                This field is required since with an empty list this policy will block all workloads.

                When using securityContext naming scheme for seccomp and including `Localhost` this array holds
                the allowed profile JSON files.

                Putting a `*` in this array will allows all JSON files to be used.

                This field is required to allow `Localhost` in securityContext as with an empty list it will block.
