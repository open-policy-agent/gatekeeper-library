              description: >-
                Any container that uses an image that matches an entry in this list will be excluded
                from enforcement. Prefix-matching can be signified with `*`. For example: `my-image-*`.

                It is recommended that users use the fully-qualified Docker image name (e.g. start with a domain name)
                in order to avoid unexpectedly exempting images from an untrusted repository.
