description: Require container images to begin with a string from a specified list of repositories or registries, or match specific image names.  The rule has been improved to allow users to distinguish between repository names, registry names, and image names, preventing bypass methods that existed in the past. For example, the rule now appends a trailing slash to repository or registry names if one is not already present. This enhancement is crucial for security, as it helps prevent attackers from bypassing controls by creating subdomains or malicious repositories that begin with the same name as those declared in the constraint file. Without the slash, a defined registry like fictional.registry.example could be exploited by an attacker setting up a malicious registry at fictional.registry.example.malicious.com. Similarly, defining a repository as "myrepo" might allow an attacker to bypass restrictions by creating a repository named "myrepoevil" on DockerHub. Additionally, this policy checks Docker image names to ensure they either match the names specified in the constraint file, end with a colon (:) for <image-name>:<tag> format, or with an at symbol (@) for <image-name>@<digest> format. This prevents attackers from using variations of valid image names to circumvent security controls.
