# IMPORTANT: Before deploying this policy, make sure you allow-list any groups
# or users that need to deploy workloads to kube-system, such as cluster-
# lifecycle controllers, addon managers, etc. Such controllers may need to
# update service account names during automated rollouts (e.g. of refactored
# configurations). You can allow-list them with the allowedGroups and
# allowedUsers properties of the NoUpdateServiceAccount Constraint.
