description: 'This policy enforces that container images must begin with a string from a specified list. The updated version, K8sAllowedReposv2, introduces support for exact match and glob-like syntax to enhance security: 1. Exact Match: By default, if the * character is not specified, the policy strictly checks for an exact match of the full registry, repository, and/or the image name. 2. Glob-like Syntax: Adding * at the end of a prefix allows prefix-based matching (e.g., registry.example.com/project/*). Only the * wildcard at the end of a string is supported. 3. Security Note: To avoid bypasses scenarios, ensure prefixes include a trailing / where appropriate (e.g., registry.example.com/project/*).'
